This is a minimal example of a book based on R Markdown and **bookdown** (https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown). 

It has been modified to include some elements of the [Open Review Toolkit](http://www.openreviewtoolkit.org/).

The book can be viewed here: <https://benmarwick.github.io/bookdown-ort>.

See the chapters `Modifications` and `Open Review` for details. The other chapters are similar to the [bookdown-demo](https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown-demo) book.
